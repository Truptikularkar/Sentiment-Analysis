# Sentiment Analysis using the BERT Model

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment or emotional tone conveyed within a piece of text. In this specific project, I am focusing on hotel reviews. The BERT model, a powerful pre-trained language representation model, has shown remarkable performance in various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis.
This code file contains a sentiment analysis project that focuses on analyzing customer reviews of hotels using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. The goal of this project is to automatically determine the sentiment expressed in these reviews, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.

# Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Food Review Data

This project focuses on conducting sentiment analysis on Amazon Food Reviews using two distinct approaches: the RoBERTa model and the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) model. The dataset for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and consists of Amazon Food Reviews. The primary objective is to compare the performance of the RoBERTa model against the VADER model in determining sentiment from text reviews.
