# Sentiment Analysis using the BERT Model

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment or emotional tone conveyed within a piece of text. In this specific project, I am focusing on hotel reviews. The BERT model, a powerful pre-trained language representation model, has shown remarkable performance in various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis.
This repository contains the code and resources for a sentiment analysis project that focuses on analyzing customer reviews of hotels using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. The goal of this project is to automatically determine the sentiment expressed in these reviews, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.
